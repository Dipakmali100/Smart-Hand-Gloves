### Smart Hand Gloves which predicts the Hand Gestures using Machine Learning and IOT

- A IoT and Machine Learning-based Solution for Individuals with Disabilities

- The Smart Hand Gloves project combines the power of Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning to assist individuals with disabilities in performing their day-to-day tasks independently.

- These innovative smart hand gloves are specifically designed to aid individuals who face challenges in executing their regular activities. By leveraging Machine Learning algorithms and IoT connectivity, these gloves can accurately predict and interpret the user's hand gestures.

- Through continuous learning and pattern recognition, the gloves become attuned to the user's unique gestures, enabling them to control various electronic devices or interact with the environment more effectively. This includes actions like turning on lights, adjusting temperature settings, operating home appliances, and more.

- The integration of IoT technology allows these smart gloves to seamlessly communicate with a wide range of compatible devices and systems, transforming them into an intuitive interface for the user. The gloves can connect wirelessly to smartphones, smart home automation systems, or any other IoT-enabled devices.

- By empowering individuals with disabilities to control their surroundings through intuitive hand gestures, the Smart Hand Gloves project aims to enhance their independence and improve their overall quality of life. It represents a significant step forward in leveraging advanced technologies to create a more inclusive and accessible world.
